    <p>This is a filler paragraph that will contain general notes on HTML.</p>
    
    <p>Below are the topics that will be covered in this section. I'm supposed to contain links to the other files in this directory. But that seemed kind of ugly, so I put them in the header. If we wanted to change them to links we would just have to move the <em>a href</em> tags to each list item's text.
